Installation
--

To install, use `go get`:

```sh
$ go get github.com/linyows/github-issues-mover
```

Usage
--

Example:

```sh
$ touch replace.yml
$ export SRC_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
$ export DST_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
$ github-issues-mover -src=foo/bar -dst=foo/bar -dst-endpoint=https://ghe.yourhost.com -sync
```

The file `replace.yml` must exist (though it can be empty), and configures replacements of imported usernames and issue comment bodies. See `replace.example.yml` for an example.

It is highly recommended to use the `-sync` flag when using the issue import API (as is the default). That API is asynchronous, so issue creations are queued in the background on GitHub, and without `-sync` issue number ordering can't be guaranteed.
